              Although John wants to fit into a crowd and pretend to be a cool guy, he also thrives on going against the grain.  This chaos, or constant conflict, is reflected in his ceramic work and writing.
            <br/>
            He likes to make vases mostly, but also crafts up interesting bowls, cups, plates and teapots. Each vase is made up of multiple pieces thrown on a wheel, then stacked, and then manipulated by hand, during his favorite part of the process, what he calls post production, when the clay is “leather hard.”   On accident, or by osmosis, John has channeled his inner japanese spirit: people have found his style to be something like wabi-sabi… which is beauty in the imperfection.
            <br/>
            When John Fukuda lived in New York, his business card said astronaut/supermodel, which in reality meant he was a struggling actor and lowlife.  Upon his return to his native California, his card now says: poet and potter, which means the ceramics keeps him feeling centered and grounded, but the writing makes him walk in circles and tear out his hair.
            <br/>
            John is based at the Temple of Mediclaytion in Venice Beach, where he works with his mentor Patrick Johnston.  John curated many events at Elektrashock Studios and also at the Venice Public Library for the Get Around, a joint effort between Mar Vista Artwalk and the Venice Art Crawl, where he can be seen selling his art on the streets.  Some people think that this is a bad decision for his art career and wont be taken serious by art galleries but thats not true.  Art galleries are going to want him in due time, he thinks.
            <br/>
            John also has a BA from USC School of Cinematic Arts.  He has acted in and co produced many short films which will soon be updated to this site… along with other ceramic photos and writing samples… so stay tuned! When he is not in the studio, John is also pursuing dreams of being an actor, novelist, and golf champ.
